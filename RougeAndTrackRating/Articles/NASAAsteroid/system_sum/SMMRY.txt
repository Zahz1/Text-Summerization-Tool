"You can usually, by rule of thumb, say the crater size is going to be 10 to 20 times the size of the object," said Lindley Johnson, the planetary defense officer at NASA. "So a half-kilometer-sized object is going to create a crater that's at least five kilometers in diameter, and it can be as much as 10 kilometers in diameter. But the area of devastation is going to be much, much broader than that, as much as 100 times the size of the crater. So an object Bennu's size impacting on the Eastern Seaboard states would pretty much devastate things up and down the coast." The improved probabilities come courtesy of NASA's OSIRIS-REX spacecraft, which spent two years studying Bennu up close.
