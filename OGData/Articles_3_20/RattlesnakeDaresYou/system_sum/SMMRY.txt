Sebastian Harris, an ecologist in Pennsylvania who has researched rattlesnakes, said, "I've definitely had a timber rattlesnake rattle very loud upon my approach only to find he was 10 or so feet away under some dense vegetation." The research began when Dr. Chagnaud, who studies the vibrating vocalizations of toadfish, wanted to compare the fish to rattlesnakes, which use similar muscles to rattle their tails.
