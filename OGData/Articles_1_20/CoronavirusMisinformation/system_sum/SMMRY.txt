In an email, Dr. Mercola said it was "Quite peculiar to me that I am named as the #1 superspreader of misinformation." Some of his Facebook posts were only liked by hundreds of people, he said, so he didn’t understand "How the relatively small number of shares could possibly cause such calamity to Biden’s multibillion dollar vaccination campaign." The efforts against him are political, Dr. Mercola added, and he accused the White House of "Illegal censorship by colluding with social media companies." He did not address whether his coronavirus claims were factual.
