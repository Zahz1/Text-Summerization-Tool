"Bobcats are very active animals that want to rip your face off. While we're working on them they're sedated. It's a privilege to be up close to the animals. The time and the care put into these animals to get them back into the wild is amazing to see." The orphaned bear cub from the Dixie fire that was admitted to Gold Country Wildlife Rescue is receiving IV fluids and veterinarians are treating its second and third degree burns with medical grade manuka honey.
